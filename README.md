# Monte-Carlo
Monte Carlo Simulations

Simulated 50 paths over a 5-year horizon for a diversified investment portfolio using historical return and covariance data from Yahoo Finance.

Applied Cholesky decomposition to incorporate inter-asset correlations between NZX50, S&P 500, and VT.

Estimated 95% Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional VaR (CVaR) from the distribution of terminal portfolio values, visualizing downside risk through cumulative return paths.
